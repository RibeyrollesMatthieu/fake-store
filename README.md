# Fake ecommerce 

This is a fake ecommerce application.  
The goal here was to create a simple app in order to learn somme technologies and progress in other ones.  
Depending on when you're looking at this, the UI may not be that good because I probably haven't dive into it yet 😅  
This is a personnal project and experience, not meant to be used in a professional way.
